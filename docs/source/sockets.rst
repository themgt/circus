Circus Sockets
==============

Circus can bind network sockets and manage them as it does for processes.

The main idea is that a child process that's created by Circus to run one of
the watcher's command can inherit from all the opened file descriptors.

That's how Apache or Unicorn works, and many other tools out there.

Goal
----

The goal of having sockets managed by Circus is to be able to manage network
applications in Circus exactly like other applications.

For example, if you use Circus with `Chaussette <http://chaussette.rtfd.org>`_
-- a WGSI server, you can get a very fast web server running and manage
*"Web Workers"* in Circus as you would do for any other process.

Splitting the socket managment from the network application itself offers
a lot of opportunities to scale and manage your stack.


Design
------

The gist of the feature is done by binding the socket and start listening
to it in **circusd**:

.. code-block:: python

    import socket

    sock = socket.socket(FAMILY, TYPE)
    sock.bind((HOST, PORT))
    sock.listen(BACKLOG)
    fd = sock.fileno()


Circus then keeps track of all the opened fds, and let the processes it
runs as children have access to them if they want.

If you create a small Python network script that you intend to run in Circus,
it could look like this:

.. code-block:: python

    import socket
    import sys

    fd = int(sys.argv[1])   # getting the FD from circus
    sock = socket.fromfd(fd, FAMILY, TYPE)

    # dealing with one request at a time
    while True:
        conn, addr = sock.accept()
        request = conn.recv(1024)
        .. do something ..
        conn.sendall(response)
        conn.close()


Then Circus could run like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [circus]
    check_delay = 5
    endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
    pubsub_endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5556
    stats_endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5557

    [watcher:dummy]
    cmd = mycoolscript $(circus.socket.foo)
    use_sockets = True
    warmup_delay = 0
    numprocesses = 5

    [socket:foo]
    host = 127.0.0.1
    port = 8888

*$(circus.socket.foo)* will be replaced by the FD value once the socket is
created and bound on the 8888 *port*.


Real-world example
------------------

`Chaussette <http://chaussette.rtfd.org>`_ is the perfect Circus companion if
you want to run your WSGI application.

Once it's installed, running 5 **meinheld** workers can be done by creating a
socket and calling the **chaussette** command in a worker, like this:

.. code-block:: ini

    [circus]
    endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5555
    pubsub_endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5556
    stats_endpoint = tcp://127.0.0.1:5557

    [watcher:web]
    cmd = chaussette --fd $(circus.socket.web) --backend meinheld mycool.app
    use_sockets = True
    numprocesses = 5

    [socket:web]
    host = 0.0.0.0
    port = 8000


We did not publish benchmarks yet, but a Web cluster managed by Circus with a Gevent
or Meinheld backend is as fast as any pre-fork WSGI server out there.
